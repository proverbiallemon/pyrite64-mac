> Note: This project does NOT use any proprietary N64 SDKs or libraries.

> [!CAUTION]
> **This Project is still not ready for general use!**<br>
> The source code has been released since it was used and largely developed for a gamejam.<br>
> However, the process of setting up the editor and support for windows/macos is still WIP.<br>
> Documentation is also missing.
> 
> Once that is done, a proper release will be made.<br>
> Sorry!

Below is the current documentation for now:
