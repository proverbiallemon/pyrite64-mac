## WARNING:
**This Project is still not ready for general use!**

The source code has been released since it was used and largely developed for a gamejam.
However, the process of setting up the editor and support for windows/macos is still WIP.
Documentation is also missing.

Once that is done, a proper release will be made.<br>
Sorry!

Below are basic build instructions for now.

## Documentation

- [Build (Editor)](./docs/build_editor.md)

### Toolchains

(@TODO: auto build/install those lazily on first projectbuild)

Next install libdragon and tiny3d, the two projects are already included in `/vendored` as git submodules.
Inside libdragon run:
```sh
./build.sh
```
For tiny3d, also run:
```sh

```
